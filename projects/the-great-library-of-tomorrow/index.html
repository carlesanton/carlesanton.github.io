Using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) deep learning models, the piece merged the faces of attendees into a single, ever-evolving collective portrait — a living character born from the presence of the public.

To achieve this, custom applications were installed on multiple iPads throughout the exhibition space. These devices detected and captured visitors’ faces, transforming them into data that could be reimagined by the AI system. Each participant became a contributor to the unfolding visual identity, their features blending seamlessly with those of others to generate new, hybrid visages.

The composite images were then projected back into the environment, where they integrated fluidly into the larger scenography of the exhibition. This dynamic loop of participation and transformation created an uncanny yet poetic experience: the audience was both observer and subject, witness and material of the artwork itself.

Beyond its technical achievement, the installation offered a reflection on identity, collectivity, and the role of technology in shaping how we see ourselves. By weaving together hundreds of individual contributions, it invited visitors to imagine a shared, interconnected self — one that transcended individuality and became symbolic of a community bound by experience.</p> </div>  <div class="mx-auto content-center grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2  w-full px-8"> <div class="flex flex-col items-center align-middle"> <img src="/img/tml/1.png" alt="Resulting portrait integrated into the exhibition" class="max-w-full rounded-sm shadow-lg mb-2  "> <p class="text-sm text-center text-gray-600">Resulting portrait integrated into the exhibition</p> </div><div class="flex flex-col items-center align-middle"> <img src="/img/tml/2-2.png" alt="Portrait display with iPads stands" class="max-w-full rounded-sm shadow-lg mb-2  "> <p class="text-sm text-center text-gray-600">Portrait display with iPads stands</p> </div> </div>   </div><div class="mt-5 flex  flex-col gap-6  content-center">  <div class="content-center px-8 w-full sm:max-w-[80%] mx-auto">  <p class="text-sm sm:text-lg font-content whitespace-pre-line">Developed and deployed as a freelance collaboration with a partner for and in close partnership with a design studio, the project combined advanced AI research with practical, multi-platform deployment.
